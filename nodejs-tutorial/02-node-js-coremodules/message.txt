Data is manipulated by using the arithmetic instructions in digital computers. Data is manipulated
to produce results necessary to give solution for the computation problems. The Addition,
subtraction, multiplication and division are the four basic arithmetic operations. If we want then
we can derive other operations by using these four operations.
